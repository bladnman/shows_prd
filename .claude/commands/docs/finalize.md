Finalize documentation using the Finalizer agent.

Read `open-agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md` and then `open-agents/agents/finalizer.md`.

Apply the Finalizer agent to: $ARGUMENTS

If no specific file is mentioned, list available documents in `docs/drafts/` and ask what should be finalized. Options:
- Finalize a single document
- Finalize the complete PRD (consolidate all drafts)

Remember: Commit every change immediately.
