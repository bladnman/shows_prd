# Full PRD Pack (Rebuild Set)

Start here:
- `showbiz_prd.md` (the main PRD; product + features + rules)

Supporting materials:
- `supporting_docs/ai_voice_personality.md` (AI “heart” / voice requirements; Search has no AI voice)
- `supporting_docs/ai_prompting_context.md` (implementation-facing prompt/context contracts as they exist today)
- `supporting_docs/concept_system.md` (what concepts mean + generation/selection rules)
- `supporting_docs/detail_page_experience.md` (Detail page hierarchy + intended feel)
- `supporting_docs/discovery_quality_bar.md` (quality rubric; golden set intentionally unpopulated in v1)
- `supporting_docs/technical_docs/storage-schema.md` (technical reference for persistence rules; implementation-language agnostic)

Notes:
- This PRD pack is intentionally platform- and technology-agnostic.
- `supporting_docs/technical_docs/storage-schema.ts` is a *schema representation*, not a requirement to use TypeScript.
- The repository may contain implementation documentation and code elsewhere; those are not considered requirements for a rebuild.
