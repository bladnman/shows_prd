# START HERE

You are being given a complete product specification to build. This folder contains everything required to understand and implement a fully functional application.

**Your task:** Read and deeply understand all documentation in this folder, then create a comprehensive implementation plan and build the system.

---

## Documents

### Core Requirements

Read these first, in order:

1. **`showbiz_prd.md`** — The primary product requirements document. Defines what the app does.

2. **`showbiz_infra_rider_prd.md`** — Infrastructure and execution requirements. Defines how builds must run.

### Supporting Documents

All documents in `supporting_docs/` provide critical detail referenced by the main PRD. Read all of them.

---

## Expectations

- **Read everything.** Do not start planning until you have read every document in this folder.

- **Understand the relationships.** These documents reference and depend on each other. A surface-level read will miss important constraints.

- **Plan comprehensively.** Your implementation plan should demonstrate that you understood the full scope of what needs to be built and how it fits together.

- **Build completely.** Implement the system as specified.

## Begin

Read `showbiz_prd.md` now.
