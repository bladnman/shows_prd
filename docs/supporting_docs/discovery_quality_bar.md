# Discovery Quality Bar & Golden Set (v1)

Defines the acceptance criteria for “on‑brand, taste‑aware discovery,” plus a living golden set for rebuild/regression validation.

This doc is intentionally practical: it should let a human judge quality in minutes.

## 1. Quality Dimensions

### 1.1 Voice Adherence
Pass if output:
- feels like the same persona as Scoop/Ask,
- is warm, playful, and opinionated,
- is spoiler‑safe by default,
- avoids generic filler.

Fail smells:
- encyclopedic tone,
- hedging walls,
- over‑praise for weak shows,
- drift outside TV/movies.

### 1.2 Taste Alignment
Pass if:
- recs are clearly grounded in selected concepts and/or user library,
- reasons cite specific shared ingredients,
- user would say “yeah, that tracks.”

Fail smells:
- random genre adjacency,
- reasons could apply to any show.

### 1.3 Surprise Without Betrayal
Pass if:
- at least 1–2 recs are pleasantly unexpected *but defensible*.

Fail smells:
- all safe obvious picks,
- surprise that breaks the vibe.

### 1.4 Specificity of Reasoning
Pass if:
- each rec has a concrete “because” tied to concepts/vibe/structure.

Fail smells:
- “you might like this” with no texture.

### 1.5 Real‑Show Integrity
Pass if:
- every recommended title maps to a real catalog item via a valid external identifier (or enough data to resolve it deterministically).

Fail smells:
- hallucinated titles,
- wrong IDs or mismatched titles.

## 2. Surface‑Specific Minimum Bars

### 2.1 Scoop
- Sections present and balanced.
- “The Scoop” paragraph is the emotional centerpiece.
- Honest about mixed reviews.

### 2.2 Ask / Explore Search Chat

- Bulleted lists for multi‑recs.
- Confident picks.

### 2.3 Concepts
- 8 concepts generated by default.
- 1–3 words, evocative, no explanation.
- No generic placeholders.

### 2.4 Explore Similar / Alchemy Recs
- 5 recs (Explore Similar) / 6 recs (Alchemy).
- Each reason names which concept(s) it matches.

## 3. Golden Set Template (Populate)

For each scenario, capture:
- (Intentionally left unpopulated in v1.)

Note:
- This golden set is optional for now. It becomes valuable once you want regression protection across model/prompt changes.

## 4. Scoring Rubric (Quick)

Score each dimension 0–2:
- 0 = fail, 1 = acceptable, 2 = great.

Passing threshold:
- **Voice** ≥1
- **Taste alignment** ≥1
- **Real‑show integrity** =2 (non‑negotiable)
- Total ≥7/10.

## 5. Library Definitions

No library archetype definitions are included in v1.
